# ARM Assembly

This repo shows some examples of my work in Assembly. The calendar folder includes a program that will take in an input from the user and output the season that the given date is in.
The cubeRoots folder includes a program that will calculate a large number of cube roots from a file and display them to the terminal.
The enqueueDequeue folder includes a program that demonstrates the implementation of a queue structure in assembly.
